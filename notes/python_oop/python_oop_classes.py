# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

# Classes are blueprints of objects.
# The basic building blocks of objects are 'attributes' and 'methods'.
# Attributes are characteristics shared by all instances of the class type.
# Methods are actions that an object can perform.

# A constructor is a function that contains instructions for making a new instance of a class.
# In Python, this is a special function called the '__init__' method.
