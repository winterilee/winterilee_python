# Conditionals
# Conditional statements allow us to run certain lines of code depending on whether certain conditions are met.
# Python uses "if", "elif", and "else".

#Operators for conditionals:
# * == : Checks if the value of two operands are equal.
# * != : Checks if the value of two operands are not equal.
# * >  : Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand.
# * <  : Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand.
# * >= : Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand.
# * <= : Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand.
# * and: Checks that each expression on the left and right are both True.
# * or : Checks if either the expression on the left or right is True.
# * not: Reverses the true-false value of the operand.

# Loops
